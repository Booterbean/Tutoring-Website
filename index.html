        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <p>My name is <a href="https://coreypredella.com/">Corey Predella</a>, and I am a student of <a href="http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/schools-colleges/melloncollegeofscience/departmentofmathematicalsciences/#honorsdegreeprogramtext">Honors Math</a> at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>. As a teaching assistant and substitute for the <a href="https://www.awesomemath.org/what-is-awesomemath/">AwesomeMath Summer Program</a>, I have had the opportunity to impart mathematical knowledge to students and help them achieve excellence in top-tier math competitions, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_America_Mathematical_Olympiad">United States Mathematical Olympiad</a>. I have successfully guided students to obtain perfect scores on their SAT and ACT math sections, as well as achieving A’s in their math coursework in school.</p>
        <p>I believe that the key to mathematical excellence is predicated on a few small adjustments in the approach, which is often missing in many U.S. school systems. I delve into this topic in my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrlZ89Uc4A0">TEDx talk</a>  on math education. As a firm believer in the beauty of mathematics, my goal is to inspire my students to appreciate its elegance while also building strong mathematical fundamentals, instilling independence, and encouraging creative problem-solving skills beyond math. I offer my services to students between the ages of 12-18 and meet them at their current skill level. As a charismatic and patient instructor, I foster inquisitiveness and curiosity in my students.</p>
        <p>My hourly rate is $50. With each session, I prepare a <a href="Logs.pdf">math handout</a>
  curated specifically to the student’s needs, which has specially selected homework problems for self-practice. As an avid computer programmer, I’ve also built <a href="https://colympi.com/">my own platform</a> to monitor student progress, assign problems, and maintain communication if they become stuck on challenge problems. If you are interested in availing my services, please fill out the form below and I’ll email back within a day.</p>
